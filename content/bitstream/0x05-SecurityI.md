----------

### What is security

-   00:02:05 What is security: Security VS Safety.
    -   Security: unexpected events that go back to an actor,
    -   Safety: maintaining a status.
-   00:07:20 Entropy: things decay. Security is not a natural state, but
    must be maintained.
-   00:09:10 Evil people: psychpaths, predators.
-   00:09:50 Circumstances: acting irrationally.
-   00:10:25 Hackers: Red Hats, joy of overcoming security systems.
-   00:11:11 WASP Privilege: no exposure to threats, stuff works most of
    the time, no incentive to learn about security.

### Systems

-   00:12:29 High trust society VS low trust society: Low trust comes
    with high cost and less functional societies.
-   00:16:16 Symptoms of societies with low trust: different
    environments are what make them.
-   00:16:50 Universal core values of humans: self-preservation,
    protecting family and friends, private zones, no drama.
-   00:18:05 High trust society needs maintenance, will get eroded
    quickly by few “bad actors”.
-   00:19:05 How can you turn a low security, low trust environment into
    a high security, high trust environment? Parallel developments also
    possible: high security, low trust societies.
-   00:19:40 Trust builds from history of interactions.
-   00:20:13 To change, bad memories must die (social memory). See
    Thomas Kuhn (1962): The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
-   00:22:10 Western states want to make people dependent on security
    (stateism) and increase state control. Thus, individuals externalize
    security, and state is presented as the White Knight.
-   00:25:15 Are we being played/gamed/manipulated by the state and
    state actors?
-   00:27:38 Just doing our jobs.
-   00:29:50 Machiavellianism: concepts how states can work.
-   00:31:20 Hegelian concepts: totalist and collectivist states and
    politics.
-   00:33:20 Look at systemic issues.

### Institutions

-   00:33:30 Inspecting institutions: 1) Police.
-   00:39:00 Policemen’s selection bias: everyone is a potential
    criminal or at least a suspect.
-   00:40:20 Documentation work of police activity by example of firing
    weapons.
-   00:42:30 Bureaucracy can work.
-   00:47:30 Police in uniform VS civilian police: both are for peace
    preservation.
-   00:48:00 Military is directed outwards.
-   00:49:00 Carl von Clausewitz: war is the extension of politics
    \[original: war is the continuation of politics by other means\].
-   00:49:39 Border guards are the middle layer between military and
    police (control of territorial boundaries VS maintaining territorial
    integrity VS maintain security within the borders).

### Intelligence services

-   00:50:00 Intelligence services:
-   Classification: Intelligence service for proper and covert action
-   00:51:00 Similarities and differences to Journalism: Are
    intelligence services also ad-driven?
-   00:51:48 Intelligence Agencies report only news that can be
    actionable.
-   00:53:40 Domestic and Foreign Intelligence Services.
-   00:54:20 Objective reporting: Not mission driven, but report driven.
-   00:54:41 Two classes of intelligence services: Report requests
    coming out of intelligence circle, or mission driven services
    (Bundesverfassungsschutz, for example).
-   00:56:30 FBI: police organization plus intelligence aspect.
-   00:57:05 Intelligence services are about information, other services
    are about action.
-   00:57:40 Staatsschutz and German Intelligence: police is for prevent
    and investigate crimes.
-   00:59:05 Forensics is for police, subversive or maybe illegal
    actions are for intelligence work. In Germany, it’s clearly
    seperated; in USA, not so much.
-   01:02:15 CIA: Considered as Intelligence Agency. Gather information
    is their mandate, not catch criminals.
-   01:05:10 Sending in intelligence to change things: huge toolkit to
    act available.
-   01:05:50 Intelligence and Military Covert Actions are not Security,
    but political action. However, it‘s a security issue for the other
    side.

### International organisations

-   01:06:47 International Security Organizations (Europol, Interpol).
    No police powers, limited investigation powers.
-   01:08:45 Working groups: example SIS (communicating warrants in EU).
-   01:09:58 Organizations: example Le Circle (high-ranking intelligence
    chiefs), Munich Security Forum (conference with high-level security
    chiefs).
-   01:15:00 Why is their image so skewed in the public? (The „Spy
    Story“)
-   01:18:00 Rubicon Series (2010)
-   01:19:25 CSI Series (2000) - all about forensic analysis of crime
    scenes, but in reality it‘s not the dominant part, only few
    questions can be answered.
-   01:21:28 Playbook crime following the standard model VS outliers.
-   01:22:55 Being secretive about methods means keeping the advantage
    from opponents: intelligence agencies VS intelligence agencies from
    other countries; police VS criminals.
-   01:23:40 Sources 1) Scientific Fields: Criminalistics, Criminology.
    (Education Material for people that train police, manuals and
    coursework can be brought on Amazon, also check out libraries).
-   01:25:34 Sources 2) Reports: Indictments, Warrants (a lot are
    public, depending on country). Caveat: contains successes and legal
    processes only.
-   01:27:08 Sources 3) Private Conversation with Policemen,
    Investigators, Intelligence People to get a more accurate picture
    about their work.

### Public private partnerships

-   01:29:39 Private Security Services.
-   01:30:45 Cybercrime Investigations: Takedown of Cyberpunker 2 (200
    servers in a German bunker).
-   01:32:25 Private Companies helping the police in Cybercrime
    Investigation.
-   01:32:40 Analyzing digital evidence: Given to a lab from a private
    company. (Cyberforensics, not done by police)
-   01:34:18 White-Collar Crime: Fraud, Commercial Fraud cases etc.
    Corporate Investigators for hire: Forensic Accountants, etc. (Police
    work only for special investigator power, or force powers.)
-   01:37:10 Corporations can use private security services when police
    are bound legally (for example, in bribing), then sanatize the data
    and give it to the police.
-   01:41:28 Informal communication lines... like in every other
    industry. (But with special privileges: Police, Military,
    Intelligence)
-   01:43:04 Presumably Cardinal Richelieu: „If you give me (three, or
    two) six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will
    find (seven reasons) something in them which will hang him.“, this
    quote might be originated by memorialist Françoise Bertraut de
    Motteville (1723), and was later paraphrased.
-   01:44:46 Real-life cases have a lot of ambiguity going on. It‘s a
    work of probabilities, not a binary process.
-   01:45:45 Can you cover up a crime as a non-corrupt policeman?
-   01:46:50 Private Security Services exploit the ambiguity of
    policework (someone bringing you from outside a full case, only
    verification needed, negative evidence often gets lost).
-   01:48:21 Political Aspect: which crimes are deemed important?
-   01:49:20 Lobbying and capital power: Intellectual Property Crimes.
-   01:50:44 Industry identifies perpretators and delivers them to
    police.
-   01:50:58 Filesharing: Machine investigating and filing reports,
    backchanneling, automated sting operation (example, IP-Echelon).
-   01:56:08 Private Agencies provide: Analysis of evidence, production
    of leads, investigation.
-   01:56:26 Money Laundering: not based on investigative results, but
    on information provided by for example NGOs (example, Transparency
    International).
-   01:59:28 Chain Analysis Companies produce risk scores for
    Cryptocurrency Adresses (public keys).
-   02:01:05 Face recognition to identify suspects: example, Clearview
    AI (finding people software)
-   02:02:20 Police relies on outside, unchecked influence: Private
    Actors (non-illegmitate).

### Private Intelligence

-   02:03:25 Recap of Episode:
    -   What outside input is influencing the police
    -   Policy definition
    -   Intelligence field
-   02:04:22 Tax crimes: special investigators who actively try to find
    criminals.
-   02:04:39 Organized Crime: preventitive task of police (dismantling
    organizations, Staatsschutz).
-   02:05:35 Civil Disobedience: infiltration by police and private
    companies.
-   02:07:00 Private Security: 3 categories
    -   private intelligence services
    -   private security services
    -   private military contractors.
-   02:09:38 Private Intelligence is information gathering.
-   02:09:53 Private Intelligence VS corporate espionage.
-   02:11:11 First example.
-   02:15:00 Why is there so much cheap spy tech for sale?
-   02:19:53 Second example: credit suisse incident.
-   02:21:12 Some serious health concerns for the operators and
    middlemen (in-betweens).
-   02:24:05 Birds of a feather flock together: blurry lines of
    corporate, state, and private decision makers (different sides of
    the law).
-   02:26:29 Book/Thesis: Stephan Blancke (2011): Geheimdienstliche
    Aktivitäten nicht-staatlicher Akteure (private intelligence
    activities by non-state actors)
-   02:27:11 Private inflitrators, informants and agent provocateurs.
-   02:28:10 Extinction rebellion and very active activists.
-   02:30:30 Capture bounties.
-   02:32:45 A quiet business: private infiltration intelligence
    services (IMSI-catchers) are often ex police, ex military etc.
-   02:34:40 Sharing information services between intelligence: 4 eyes,
    14 eyes.
-   02:38:05 HCPP and game theory: will the cryptoanarchists ever get
    something done?
-   02:39:00 Today’s security system is like antique byzantine, easy to
    understand from outside, inside not easy to understand- even for the
    players themselves.
-   02:40:25 Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road made agents run with money---is
    it the only case, only in this direction?
-   02:42:00 State systems’ marketing: “protect and serve” by angels?
    But, ACAB is also wrong.
-   02:45:55 Take personal responsibility for own security.

### Outlook

-   02:48:40 Developments/outlook: technologies that make globalization
    possible, organizational technologies, reporting and communication.
-   02:50:25 Old days: reporting was sampling (today: big data, AI).
-   02:51:00 New incentive structures: financial markets. Old: financial
    markets were not global, slow. Today: Global financial markets mean
    indirect profit from activities like war, markets can be complex,
    distributed, longer reach.
-   02:52:50 Even dumb criminals can use smart technologies (Dropgangs).
-   02:54:00 The mastermind/ intelligent criminals VS random criminals:
    attribution becomes problematic (witness problem, no review
    pointers).
-   02:57:24 Book: Evan Ratliff (2019): The Mastermind. Drugs. Empire.
    Murder. Betrayal. (Paul LeRoux)
