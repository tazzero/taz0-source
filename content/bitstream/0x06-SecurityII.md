### Section I Future of Security

#### Introduction: Emotional Reach, Classifying the Population, Keeping the Legitimacy

-   00:02:16 Crimes that really matter: How do security forces select
    the crimes they battle against, which ones are ignored.
-   00:02:33 Limitations of Crimefighting: War on drugs is ongoing,
    street robberies, etc.
-   00:03:30 State is focussing on crimes that risk itself, and on high
    public image.
-   00:04:30 Public percerption is high when public can identify and
    empathize with the victim (child abuse, burglary).
-   00:05:45 Germany: First case of predictive policing was burglary.
-   00:07:40 The victim matters / vulnerability: People do react less
    with assault of a 20-30 year old man, than with the elderly, women,
    or children.
-   00:09:13 Child porn is the universal crime where everybody gets
    behind the police, ...and that is used for higher surveillance.
    Child pornography is the abdomination of the 21st century.
-   00:10:15 A lot of murder, a lot of kidnapping, a lot of burglaries
    etc, undermindes the belief in the state. Other crimes do not affect
    the trust so much, i.e. insurance fraud. Nobody's sorry about big
    corporations being scammed.

### Systemic Risk Categories: Crimes That Matter

#### First Example

-   00:11:34 First Example: Proliferation. Atomic weapon possession
    divide Good states from Bad States.
-   00:12:05 BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) and Proliferation.
-   00:12:30 Enemy States cooperated at the fall of Soviet Block and
    UdSSR, because of Proliferation.
-   00:15:20 Blind field of Proliferation: Smuggling of Nuclear
    Material, Technology, Warheads. Sensor Networks to detect nuclear
    material (isotope scanners).
-   00:17:40 Rumors: Unofficial and missing warhead counts (former
    Soviet, US, Plane incidents over Mediterrean Sea).
-   00:20:04 Rumors: Cold War Soviet Union Sleeper Agents with Suitcase
    Bombs (not all recovered).
-   00:22:00 Small States profit from deterrent threat of Warheads, less
    likely to actually use them (cannot be retrieved).
-   00:22:50 Terrorist Organizations and Warheads: rely on secure
    territory (hollowed out state): Iran, Afghanistan, Mexico.
-   00:24:07 Example: Afghanistan tolerating Al-Qaeda and 9/11.
-   00:25:15 Just having the device doesn't mean you're able to trigger
    it: where is it from, maintenance, deploy (actors who follow
    through, reliable remote triggers), maybe a lot of the old warheads
    are not usable (physical trigger method is lost).

#### Second Example

-   00:30:35 Second Example: Transnational Organized Crime (Narco
    Cartels, MS-13, Triads, etc).
-   00:32:00 Safe Havens (no-go-areas) by MS-13 and Al-Qaeda: low level
    of immunity and souvereignity.
-   00:35:35 Narco-Terrorism: Cooperations between terrorist
    organizations and pure criminal organizations.
-   00:36:50 Iran-Contra (Freedom Fighter VS Terrorist).
-   00:37:47 A scared population is more likely to use drugs.
-   00:38:25 Big criminal organizations undermine the state
    institutions: corruption, blackmail, threats.
-   00:39:35 Loyalty and Trust within Institutions is undermined, and
    thus the political head becomes just an illusion of power (Mexico,
    Miami in the 80s, etc).

#### Third Example

-   00:37:47 Third Example: Bioterrorism.
-   00:43:12 CRISPR sequencing, "build your own smallpox".
-   00:44:00 Non-state actors: Aum Shinrikyo (Aleph) and Tokyo Subway
    Attacks (Sarin Gas).
-   00:46:19 2001 Anthrax Attacks in the US.
-   00:47:16 Rumor: Wuhan might be a targeted virus attack, but it's
    hard and too early to tell.
-   00:48:14 For states: bioweapons would also attack own citizens,
    unlimited transmission, contagion risks high (better: easy to
    contain, infectious chain are short and unstable).
-   00:49:30 Terrorists: cannot attach threats or demands, since viruses
    are non-attributable. Exceptions: doomsday sects, radical
    environmentalists.

### Wrap-Up Section I

-   00:50:47 Wrap-Up first Part: Crimes That Matter. All are technology
    supported crimes.
-   00:51:33 Transnational organized crime is a late development (cheap
    travels, cheap organization and management technologies, cheap
    communication), also a part of globalization.
-   00:52:49 Technological developments are supporting two classes of
    criminals: random criminals, child pornography.
-   00:53:05 Random Criminal: uses technology to amplyfy his effect.
-   00:53:25 Child Pornography: digital cameras and internet made it
    really problematic, because it became cheap and easy (all you need
    is a mobile phone).

### Section II Dystopian Side

#### Cybercrime, Robotic Warfare, Omniviolence

-   00:56:38 Skimming: copying credit cards, via cheap tech from the
    darknet and Aliexpress.
-   00:58:35 Issue of non-attribution in Cybercrime: you don't have to
    be very smart, you randomly target victims, plus degree of
    seperation (=every idiot can become a phisher).
-   00:59:34 High IQ cyber-criminals plus tech: bigger and much more
    efficient organizations are possible (Paul LeRoux).
-   01:01:10 Strategic thinking criminals: do no make random mistakes,
    access to cheap and easy components (Shenzhen), low morals,
    power-hungry individuals.
-   01:03:00 Omniviolence: Killer to killed persons ratio increases,
    systemic risks to countries, maybe entire planet (Example: nuclear
    and bio weapons).
-   01:04:22 Robotic warfare: Drones plus biometrics.
-   01:06:00 The State and Omniviolence: Intelligence services already
    working on it. Threat becomes increasingly realistic, while not
    being trivial to deal with, or understand. Thing that is most likely
    to shape the future.
-   01:07:19 Realistic scenario by now: Quadrocopter drones, single shot
    explosive inside, plus facial recognition (ESP32 development kit).
-   01:08:55 Ground based autonomous vehicles is in the future of next
    generation: DJi RoboMaster-s1, educational toy for children,
    available today. Already has face and object recognition, autonomy
    features.
-   01:10:21 Next 5-10 years: First autonomous robot school killing is
    realistic.
-   01:10:38 There happen to be people out there, who are relatively
    smart, and there happens to be a huge technological toolbox to
    select from. Given it enough intelligence, and enough energy, drive,
    and goals, you can be really dangerous these days.
-   01:11:10 Book: "Gefährliche Menschen (Dangerous Humans)" near-future
    dystopian world where the whole system is focussed on preventing
    omniviolence.
-   01:12:47 State tries to counteract omniviolence and others by
    regulating technology.

#### Drugs and Butterflies

-   01:13:07 How can you control potentially dangerous people?
-   01:13:50 The tech industry and self-medicating with legal and
    illegal drugs, and an unrealistic dream.
-   01:15:38 Advertisement of drugs as "rebellious". Drugs being
    marketed as rebellion,... (they) don't help you to become an actual
    rebel, and actually being effective.
-   01:16:24 Academia: The clever people trap, researching butterflies
    (you are being seen and heard, aurelians and lepidopterists, and
    your work matters).

#### Preventive detention

-   01:17:47 Preventive detention. "If I lock this person up, I can
    prevent crime in the future."
-   01:19:05 Psychiatric detention, used to silence people and put them
    away (Gustl Mollath).
-   01:20:40 New preventive detention laws: limiting personal liberty to
    prevent crimes? Social and economic consequences.

#### Surveillance, Cryptography, and Regulations

-   01:21:50 Surveillance is everywhere.
-   01:22:33 Growth of surveillance: Commercial interest, collecting
    data, nudging.
-   01:22:50 Using surveillance data for AI training, run through neural
    networks (health: predict illnesses), can also be used to predict
    behavior.
-   01:24:05 Nation-States surveil the shit out of everything to
    increase their security status (international trend).
-   01:24:17 New proposals for regulation, or ban, of face-recognition
    (EU, some US states).
-   01:25:00 Limitations of face-recognition: black people with dark
    skin. AI training sets are mostly light-skinned.
-   01:26:25 Why states might be open to proposals: Accusations of
    racial bias, easy thing to give up (it's commercialized already, see
    ClearView AI).
-   01:27:17 Face Recognition Apps (Russia: FindFace App), Face
    Recognition Spiders (原谅宝官方 yuanliang bao guanfang,
    https://pornstarbyface.com/, https://deepmindy.com/)
-   01:28:13 Navigate the tech landscape through regulations: example
    drone sector.
-   01:31:00 Regulating cryptography: access to good cryptography for
    average joe is hard.
-   01:31:22 Even for relatively smart and motivated people, ...
    implementing cryptographic systems by people who are not specialized
    in that, usually goes wrong. It's really hard to build secure
    cryptographic software, even with libraries out there, etc.
-   01:33:20 Regulations of sales controls: example chemicals,
    pharmarcies.
-   01:34:00 State will increase security in the future by regulating
    technology (regulating both components and knowledge).
-   01:34:50 Dystopian Vision, "black ball events": Omniviolence will be
    prevented by total surveillance combined with AI. (Bostrom:
    Vulnerable World Paper)
-   01:36:04 Anomaly detection: preventing anyone from building
    potentially threatening tech, without actually understanding or
    knowing what this tech is.
-   01:36:59 Securocrat's decisions are based on body-count and not on
    life quality.
-   01:37:20 Some cattle farmer talk: Consume, pay taxes, and put your
    VR goggles on.
-   01:40:10 Preventing people who are too intelligent, too creative,
    from getting anywhere in life.
-   01:41:00 Cambridge Analytics for the Masses, Psychography: limit
    access, social scoring systems (today mostly reactive).
-   01:42:20 Predictive Technologies: sentencing rules in US.
-   01:43:20 Creativity problem: detect outliers, categorize in good or
    bad, adjust access to technology. (Ender's Game pilots)
-   01:44:44 Already using licensing by personality: bank accounts, gun
    licenses. Where does the reliability score come from? Future might
    be more automated.
-   01:46:50 Future: Same thing, but advanced by modern technology.
-   01:47:08 Reactive scores, predicitive regulation: lawyers, MDs,
    pilot and weapon licenses. If you have a lot of points, they won't
    give you the license.
-   01:47:32 e-Government: maybe no human judgement in the future
    needed.
-   01:49:00 Looking at the Chinese petri dish: since Wuhan epidemic,
    deploying surveillance is cranked up.
-   01:50:37 Data Analysis, Laboratory for Surveillance: Locking down
    neighborhoods, limit travel within city, using drones, using CCTV
    cameras to check masks and temperature, booking details, location
    tracking, etc.
-   01:55:00 Wuhan as a dystopian prison: at least as frightening as the
    pandemic.
-   01:56:03 Control ratio: the amount of people you need to control a
    huge population is going down.
-   01:56:20 Conflict Turkey-Syria, Idlib region: areal control by
    grenade launchers, automatically engaged.
-   01:58:48 South Korea Border Patrol Bots: automated targeting (Sentry
    SGR-A1, Hankook Mirae Method-2?)
-   01:59:33 UAV Drones: autonomous suicide drones, waiting for target
    or flying into target.
-   02:00:09 Germany declared AI a "critical defense technology" =
    weapon technology for killing people.

### Section III Less Dystopian Side

-   02:01:44 Donation Report
-   02:04:25 Forum/ BBS: Async.pre

#### Frank and Smuggler answering your questions!

-   02:05:49 Question Section
-   02:05:57 Forum: How would the average aspiring second-realmer get
    their nym used in legal documents or at their work place? Is that a
    realistic goal?
-   02:14:00 Forum: I'd really like to see you guys cover the art of
    clandestine purchasing. For example, do 3D printers have hidden
    tracking codes like paper printers? Discussing details on aquiring
    something like this with a pre-paid credit card and how to ship it
    to a non-attributate address would be cool.
-   02:15:35 Forum: One Issue that I always find very hard is receiving
    shipments by mail. Not necessarily very illegal items, but maybe
    items you just don't want to receive at an attributable adress and
    that are larger than what fits in a standard letterbox. How to
    receive things in another name and where with the least amount of
    trouble and risk?
-   02:20:25 Forum: How to beat facial recognition during
    drop-operations and otherwise? What methods are effective? How often
    worn outside the TAZ?
-   02:23:25 Twitter: How to go into darknet? Virtual box and TOR? Which
    OS?
-   02:25:27 Twitter: In terms of cyber-warfare, which state (or state
    proxy) has the most tactical technical capacity for attacks and
    defense?
-   02:33:55 Thoughts on accelerationism?
-   02:37:14 Mail: I find howtovanish.com very helpful, even though it
    is outdated and US-centric. Are there more current and EU-centric
    versions of the topic, how can I make my life as anonymous as
    possible?
